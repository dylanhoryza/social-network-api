# social-network-api
## Description
- My motivation for this project was to be able to build my own social network api that can store multiple data like friends, reactions and thoughts.
- I built this projec to further my knowledge of noSQL and MongoDB and to be able to build my own sizeable API.
- This application solves the problem of creating a database that can store friend and reaction data to further scale into a social network application.
- I learned how to create a database using MongoDB, and how to get the files to work together by exporting functions and organizing in the MVC format.
